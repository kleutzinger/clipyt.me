- You can edit the times after adding the video
- Try pasting a youtube link with a timestamp (right click a yt video)
- You can drag one of the links already in the playlist into the video id box
- The url stays updated so you can send it to a friend straight from the url bar
	-This also means bookmarking pages works
- Put the start time at 0 and the end time at -1 to add an entire video
- Change the title of the playlist by clicking the title
